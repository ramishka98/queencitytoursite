                <p style="color: black;text-align: justify;padding: 5%;">Queenstown, New Zealand is known as the adrenaline capital of the world for a reason. It is home to some of the most thrilling adventure activities on the planet, from bungy jumping and skydiving to jet boating and white-water rafting. But in recent years, Queenstown has also become a leader in sustainable tourism, with many of its adventure operators giving back to the environment and the local community.

					<br>One way that Queenstown adventure operators are giving back is by offsetting their carbon emissions. For example, Ziptrek Ecotours is Queenstown's first carbon neutral tour operator. They have offset their emissions by planting native forests in New Zealand. Another example is Shotover Jet, which is owned by Ngāi Tahu Tourism. Ngāi Tahu Tourism has always been committed to reducing its environmental impact, and is currently testing an electric jet boat prototype.
					
					<br>Queenstown adventure operators are also giving back by working with inclusive tourism experts to make their activities more accessible to everyone. For example, Canyon Swing has worked with Jezza Williams from Makingtrax to improve their experience for all. And Shotover Jet has done their best to make the experience as accessible as possible for people with disabilities.</p>
